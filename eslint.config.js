// Flat ESLint config, carried over from Cadence. The point of having this at
// all is narrow: the verify scripts prove the ARITHMETIC is right - that a
// payment on a 60-month loan comes out to the cent - but they never mount a
// component, so they are blind to the class of bug that lives in React itself. A value captured stale
// in a closure, an effect that re-runs when it shouldn't, a variable that is
// quietly undefined. Those are what this catches.
//
// Deliberately not a style guide. Nothing here reformats code or argues about
// quotes; every rule below describes a way the app can actually misbehave.
